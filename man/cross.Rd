\title{Cross with random mating, or equal contributions, or randomly between two populations}
\usage{
cross(sEnv = simEnv, nProgeny = 100, equalContribution = F,
  popID = NULL, popID2 = NULL, notWithinFam = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{sEnv}{the environment that BSL functions operate in. Default is "simEnv" so use that to avoid specifying when calling functions}

\item{nProgeny}{the number of progenies}

\item{equalContribution}{if T all individuals used the same number of times as parents, if F individuals chosen at random to be parents}

\item{popID}{population ID to be crossed. Default: the last population}

\item{popID2}{population ID to be crossed with popID to make hybrids. Default: second population not used.}
}
\value{
modifies the list sims in environment sEnv by creating a progeny population as specified, with an incremented population number
